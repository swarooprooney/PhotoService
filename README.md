# PhotoService

Use this service if you want to add a profile photo. This uses cloudinary in the backend. I have made this simple so that no authentication is required.

You just pass in file from you application and you will get a GUID and URL back. The GUID is to be used in all further communications with the API and URL is where your image will be hosted
